       "\"The grizzly bear is a North American subspecies of the brown bear. Grizzlies are typically brown, though their fur can appear to be white-tipped, or grizzled, lending them their name. They are powerful, top-of-the-food-chain predators, yet much of their diet consists of nuts, berries, fruit, leaves, and roots. Despite their impressive size, grizzlies have been clocked running at 30 miles an hour. They can be dangerous to humans, particularly if surprised or if humans come between a mother and her cubs. At its peak, the grizzly population numbered more than 50,000. In 1975, grizzly bears were listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Today there are more than five times the number of grizzlies than there were in 1975—and about 1,400 to 1,700 in the contiguous United States. They’re one of the most iconic residents of Yellowstone National Park. Many grizzlies still roam the wilds of Canada and Alaska, where hunters pursue them as big game trophies. There have been some controversial attempts to remove those protections in recent years. But they aren’t in the clear yet, as federal courts have blocked both attempts twice, over concerns about the lack of genetic diversity among this subspecies whose populations live so far apart. Conservationists also worry that delisting Grizzly bears would lead to renewed hunting again, and that deplete the population would lead that hunting would again lead to renewing the hunting. They're considered a conservation success story. Ever since they gained protections under the United States Endangered species Act, the population of grizzley bears has grown. The U.s. Fish and Wildlife Service established recovery zones for the bears and set out to improve relationships between humans and bears by educating the public about these animals and establishing programs to reimburse ranchers for livestock bears killed. These animals need a lot of space—their home range can encompass up to 600 square miles. Their ideal habitat is one that is isolated from development and has plenty of food and places to dig their dens, often holing up in a suitable-looking hillside. Females give birth during this winter rest, often to twins. Grizzlies can be seen at prime Alaskan fishing spots when the salmon run upstream for summer spawning. In this season, dozens of bears may gather to feast on the fish, craving fats that will sustain them through the long winter ahead. They also eat other animals, from rodents to moose. They have long, long claws, sensitive noses, and sensitive noses that help them sustain themselves through hibernation for the calories that will help them through their hibernation. The grizzly has a 25-year life span in the wild. The average age of a grizzly is 25 years, and it can live up to 30 years in its natural habitat. It can be found in parts of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and Washington State, where grizzly populations can still be found.\""

      "Humpbacks and other whales sing by forcing air through their nasal cavities. While both males and females sing, only the males sing the especially long songs that can typically last for up to 20 minutes. Some Humpbacks have been known to sing non-stop for over 24 hours\n",
      "Humpbacks make a long migration twice every year. They travel to cooler polar water in summers to feed, then to warmer tropical waters in the winter to breed. A Humpback’s song can be heard from as far as almost 20 km away.\n",
      "Humpbacks are mainly black or grey with white undersides to their flukes, flippers and bellies They are 15m long One of the most noticeable characteristics of humpback whales is their long flippers. They breach more than any other baleen whales.\n",
      "Humpback songs appear to be shared by all singing members in the same area of the ocean. This sharing of songs may occur when groups intermingle during migration or in shared summer feeding grounds. The whales may repeat the same song for several hours at a time.\n",
      "In the northern hemisphere, humpback whales are found in the north Pacific, from South-East Alaska, Prince William Sound, and British Columbia. Humpbacks migrate seasonally to Hawaii, the Gulf of California, Mexico and Costa Rica.\n",
      "Some humpbacks have been observed creating \"bubble nets\" to catch their prey. The whales dive deep then swim up in a spiral pattern, while releasing a steady stream of bubbles from their blow holes. As the bubbles rise they form a \"net\" that surrounds the whales' prey\n",

      "The word deer has been applied at times to species that are not cervids, such as the musk deer (Moschus) and mouse deer (Tragulus) The former is now placed in a separate family (Moschidae), while mouse deer are actually primitive rumin\n",
      "The single antlerless form, the Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis), reflects an earlier pre-antler condition. In this primitive condition males have long, sharp upper canines, called tusks, that are used for slashing and stabbing in territorial contests.\n",
      "Deer are specialized herbivores, as is reflected in their large and anatomically complex digestive organs, their mobile lips, and the size and complexity of their teeth. However, deer rely little on coarse-fibred grasses, and they have not evolved grazing specializations\n",
      "The bias of deer toward high-quality food has its origin in the very high demands of antler growth for minerals, protein, and energy. The growing antlers are encased in “velvet,” a highly vascularized, nerve-filled skin covered by short,\n",
      "Antlers are used as weapons and shields in combat or as display organs in courtship Normally shed after the mating season, antlers may be retained in some territorial tropical deer for more than a year. Large-bodied species require more nutrients and energy to grow antlers than do small-\n",
      "The requirement for nutrients and energy has severe repercussions on the ecology of deer. It confines deer to relatively productive habitats, excluding them from deserts, dry grasslands, and geologically old landscapes leached of nutrients. It severely limits the abundance of Cervidae in mature, species-rich\n",
      "Some disturbances, such as river flooding and the rise and fall of lake levels, occur annually and create local, perpetually immature, nutrient-rich ecosystems. Since disturbances such as wildfires, storm floods, avalanches, or wind-felled trees are unpredictable, deer have evolved great abilities to\n",
      "While deer tend to have broad, somewhat similar food habits, they are highly divergent in their antipredator strategies. This divergence segregates species ecologically and thus minimizes potential food competition between species sharing the same space.\n",
      "The family Cervidae divides into two fairly distinct groups, the Old World deer and the New World deer. This division reflects where the deer originally evolved; however, now it is not a geographical distinction but instead derives from their different foot structures.\n",
      "The Old World deer include the 11 species of tropical Asian muntjacs (genus Muntiacus), the most primitive deer. The next evolutionary step is represented by tropical and subtropical deer that have a basic three-pronged antler plan. In the New\n",

      "Deer have small, unspecialized stomachs by ruminant standards, and high nutrition requirements. They select easily digestible shoots, young leaves, fresh grasses, soft twigs, fruit, fungi, and lichens.\n",
      "Antlers grow as highly vascular spongy tissue covered in a skin called velvet. Before the beginning of a species' mating season, the antlers calcify under the velvet and become hard bone. The velvet is then rubbed off leaving dead bone which forms the hard antlers.\n",
      "Mule deer (and Black-tailed Deer), species within the same genus as the white-tailed deer, instead have bifurcated (or branched) antlers. A rub is used to deposit scent from glands near the eye and forehead and physically mark territory.\n",

      "The bobcat is crepuscular, and is active mostly during twilight. It keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight, and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise. Each night, it moves from 2 to 7 mi (32 to 113 km\n",
      "In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters. The sizes of bobcats' home ranges vary significantly and ranges from 023 to 126 sq mi (060 to 32634 km2)\n",
      "Reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal. Like most felines, the bobcat is largely solitary, but ranges often overlap. Dispersal from the natal range is most pronounced with males.\n",
      "In line with widely differing estimates of home range size, population density figures diverge from one to 38 bobcats per 10 sq mi (26 km2) in one survey. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's home range. When multiple territories\n",

      "You might not realize that dolphins are closely related to whales. The scientific order, called Cetacea, includes dolphins, whales, and porpoises. The dolphin family Delphinidae has 36 species in all.\n",
      "Dolphins have smooth skin, flippers, and a dorsal fin. They have a long, slender snout with about 100 teeth. The single blowhole on top of their head has a flap that opens to reveal a pair of nostrils.\n",
      "Dolphins have an eye on each side of their head, so they can see ahead, to the side, and behind them. They can also see very well both underwater and above water. Their vision out of the water is about as good as a cat’s or a dog\n",
      "Researchers have described dolphin sounds as screams, calls, moans, trills, grunts, squeaks, and even a creaky door sound. Bottlenose dolphin researchers think that slow clicks and high-pitched whistles are signs of contentment, while harsh, low squ\n",
      "Dolphins are known to travel with ships, leaping in front of the bow and swimming in the wake. Dolphins that live in rivers have excellent echolocation for fishing in muddy waters. Dolphins are found in all the oceans of the world.\n",
      "Dolphins live and play in schools of five to hundreds of animals. Most dolphins eat fish, octopus, squid, and shrimp. Killer whales include seals, smaller whales, penguins, birds, and even small walrus in their diet.\n",
      "In 2000, many countries joined the International Dolphin Conservation Program, which is an international agreement to reduce the numbers of dolphins that are lost through tuna fishing. Some, like the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, are protected in US waters.\n",
      "The three best-known dolphins—white-sided dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and spinner dolphins—can be seen in marine mammal demonstrations, on television shows, and in movies. Every dolphin has its own distinct whistle to communicate with others in its pod.\n",
      "Dolphins are small-toothed cetaceans easily recognizable by their curved mouths. There are 36 dolphin species, found in every ocean. Most dolphins are marine and live in the ocean or brackish waters along coastlines.\n",
      "Dolphins feed chiefly on fish and squid, which they track using echolocation, a built-in sonar that bounces sound waves off prey and reveals information like its location, size, and shape. The smallest, the Maui dolphin, is just five feet long.\n",
      "Dolphins are graceful, sleek swimmers that can reach speeds of more than 18 miles an hour. For centuries, people have hunted dolphins for their meat and blubber. Today, their main threat comes from being caught accidentally in commercial fishing nets.\n",

      "Dolphins give birth to live young and do not lay eggs. They can get pregnant on average every two to four years. Dolphin calves tend to stay close to their mothers for a few years before venturing off on their own.\n",
      "Did you know that dolphins start life with body hair? Newborn calves have hairs on their rostrum (their beak) that fall out soon after birth. This is believed to be an evolutionary remnant from when they lived on land.\n",
      "The human body is comprised of about 75% water, and once in the water, we provide a prime structure for echolocation. This is how dolphins are able to discern that the metal is denser than human flesh, which is mostly water.\n"

      "Dolphins communicate through more than just clicks and whistles. They can also slap the water's surface with their tail or bodies, which is officially termed breaching. There are three main ways: whistles, echolocation, and social communication.\n",
      "These whistles can be heard by others of the species from miles away. Their whistle repertoire can change as they get older, and dolphins who bond with one another can learn each others signature whistles. Click on the links below to listen to the whistles of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins\n",
      "There are dozens of species of dolphins and each has their own unique habitats, appearance, and behaviors. The dolphin emits a sound and then listens for the echo as that sound bounces off of objects. Dolphins are able to get much more information out of the sound than humans.\n",
      "Dolphins come in all shapes and sizes, and each species has their own unique features. Many dolphin species can form groups of over 1,000 individuals, known as super pods. Here's how to recognize a few of the most striking and unusual dolphin species.\n",
      "Commerson's Dolphin is found off the coast of Argentina and in parts of the Indian Ocean. Risso's dolphins love deeper waters, where they seek out a diet of squid and other deepwater fish species. Killer whales are the world's largest dolphins.\n",
      "Short-finned pilot whale has an unusual, squared-off head and lacks the long beak of most dolphin species. Spinner dolphins have earned their name, in part, for the high jumping spins they take out of the water. They typically have a bold black and white pattern\n",
      "This shy, elusive dolphin species share a similar black and white color pattern to killer whales, but they are a fraction of the size. The striped dolphin can live in very large groups, and they perform elaborate acrobatics when they leap into the air.\n",
      "Most dolphins at Dolphins Plus are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. These majestic animals are dark grey and, as you'd expect from the name, have a short and blunt rostrum. They live throughout the world in warmer waters and have a number of interesting features.\n",
      "The typical length for an adult bottlenose dolphin can range between 6 to over 12 feet and they can weigh over a 1,000 pounds. Dolphins thrive in both tropical and cooler, more temperate waters.\n",
      "Dolphins are under threat worldwide, mainly human generated threats. Two of the biggest issues are entanglement in fishing gear and nets, and pollution. Dolphins often pursue the same fish species that commercial fishing ships are hunting and may get accidentally caught in their nets.\n",
      "Dolphin reproduction often involves putting on displays including posturing and vocalizations to attract a mate. Dolphins gestate for 12 months and calves are typically born tail first. Human-created pollution that is affecting the world's oceans is causing a wide variety of problems for dolphins.\n",
      "Dolphin habitats can be found everywhere from open oceans to coastlines to river basins. Some species are migratory and adapt well to changes in their environment. Other species are closely tied to one place and come under threat when humans begin developing the area.\n",
      "Dolphins are best known for living in the ocean, but there are also endangered freshwater varieties. The Indian Ocean is the native environment for large numbers of bottlenose, spinner, and common dolphins. The Amazon River dolphin is comparatively small, weighing up to 350 pounds, and adults\n",
      "Are dolphins endangered? Yes, there are dozens of species of dolphin that are endangered and now extinct. Some of the most threatened species are the ones that come into contact with humans most frequently. This includes the Yangtze River dolphin, the Maui dolphin, and the Ganges River\n",
      "The species decline is due to many issues, one of which is that they are very slow breeders. Most dolphins reproduce an average of every couple of years, but for this species, it's 6-7 years. They also face threats to their habitats and food sources.\n",
      "Even small changes you make can have a big impact on the future of dolphins in the world. Some are friendly and curious while others are skittish and avoid human contact. Don't do this in the wild; appreciate them from a distance.\n",
      "If you see someone feeding dolphins in the wild, report them to the authorities. Do not touch or pet dolphins, even if they come close. Stay at a safe distance when viewing dolphins from an aircraft.\n",
      "Stay quiet and avoid loud noises A startled dolphin may end up separated from their pod. Discard unwanted or waste fishing lines safely. You can also fish with specially designed dissolving hooks instead of the stainless steel varieties.\n",

      "The 40 different species can be found in a vast geographic region, which makes it very difficult to estimate the current population of dolphins. The smallest, the Maui dolphin, grows to an average 5.5 m.\n",
      "The largest dolphin is the Killer Whale, which can grow up to 310 ft (95 m) in length, weighing 22,000 lb (9,980 kg) Dolphins are meat eaters and have a steady diet of squid, fish and crustaceans. Although the coloration of\n",

      "Dolphins (and sea lions) have been trained to help rescue lost naval swimmers, and to locate underwater mines. They are extremely social and playful mammals. Dolphins have been observed looking after the old, sick and injured in a pod.\n",
      "Dolphins have the ability to shut off half of their brain, which goes to sleep. The other half stays active so that the mammal can continue to breathe and even swim. Dolphins will also follow other whales, sea birds and even fishing boats to feed on the marine life each scares up\n",
      "The gestation period varies depending on the species, and can be as little as nine months and as long as 17 months. Typically, there is just one calf, and twins are rare. The mother and calf will spend years together.\n",
      "The toothed whale group that dolphins belong to include oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae), river dolphins (Iniidae) and Indian river dolphins. There are many species in the group of true dolphins. The word dolphin actually identifies several marine mammals.\n",
      "Dolphins do not have actual ear holes or openings to hear with. Instead, they ‘listen’ with the small slits that are located behind their eyes. They hear frequencies 10 times the upper limit of adult human hearing.\n",
      "Based on their anatomy, dolphins are without olfactory lobes and nerves like all other toothed whales. As they do not have these anatomical features, scientists have concluded that dolphins very likely have little if any sense of smell. They have a mouth full of teeth, but never\n",
